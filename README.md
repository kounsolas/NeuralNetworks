# NeuralNetworks
This is a repo where i will commit my code for Neural Networks, a class that i am attending in 2024

I am using CIFAR-10 dataset
I have downloaded the files from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
To run the program you will have to download the cifar 10 dataset and my code in the same folder.

In this project, I focused on data preprocessing and classification algorithms, including K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) and Nearest Centroid. For classification on the CIFAR-10 dataset, I implemented both linear and non-linear models and worked on optimizing their parameters. Additionally, I developed Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to enhance classification performance.
