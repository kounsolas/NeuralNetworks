# NeuralNetworks
This is a repo where i will commit my code for Neural Networks, a class that i am attending in 2024

I am using CIFAR-10 dataset
I have downloaded the files from https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
To run the program you will have to download the cifar 10 dataset and my code in the same folder.
